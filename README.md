# Graphical-Route-Calculation-for-Navigation

 A C++ code that will help find the shortest path between any two buildings in the Northeastern University Boston campus. For this I utilized the Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to implement the
 program. 

 Firstly, I created the drawing of the undirected graph as step (1). I labeled the graph with vertices numbers, building character codes, and optionally the intersections
 character codes. Also, I have the edges labeled with the distances calculated from Google Maps.

 The project.pdf has screen shots of at least two sample runs of the program, including copies of the graph created in step (1) in which shortest path generated by the sample runs is 
 highlighted. Also included are the screenshots of the Google map walking directions corresponding to the sample runs.
